# AI News Sentiment Pipeline

This small project tries to build a modular data pipeline that fetches, processes, and analyses news about **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** using the [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org).  

This pipeline performs basic sentiment analysis (positive / neutral / negative) and evaluates the results for further insights.

## Project flow

- Fetch AI-related news via the NewsAPI.
- Preprocess and clean the text data.
- Simulate or perform a sentiment analysis.
- Aggregate and evaluate the results.
- Visualize or export them (CSV, notebook).

## Technical requirements
- **Python 3.11+**
- **JupyterLab** for experimentation
- **Requests** for fetching data
- **Pandas / NumPy** for data processing
- **NLTK** for sentiment analysis (tbc.)
- **Matplotlib** for visualization
- **Git + GitHub** for version control
